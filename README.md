# How to make a squishy controller for a Unity game

This is a workshop that explores a new interface for tangible interaction.

Using a pressure sensor as an analog input during the workshop we will understand how analog communication differs from digital communication in electronics, how to setup the sensor for basic prototyping and experiment in designing a controller for a simple Unity game.

## Skills acquired
Analog and digital communication
Serial communication with Arduino UNO 
Circuit sketch reading and designing
Tangible interaction prototyping
Unity game design

## Material
Arduino UNO 
Pressure Sensor MPX5010GP CASE 867B-04 (Available in Digikey and Mouser)
Prototyping cables 
Small breadboard
1/8'' ID Flexible Vynil tubbing 
Acrylic or plywood to mount the prototype 
Enema bulb/ bulb syringe/regular syringe/Slime )
4mm screws or double sided permanent tape to fix components
M2 Standoffs to make prototype
